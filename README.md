<h1>Todo App with React/Redux</h1>

Ability to post/get todos from a MongoDB. 

<h2>Things to fix:</h2>

When adding a todo, wait for a response from the server, 
then add the todo if there is a response, else don't dispatch add todo action.

When removing a todo, remove the one clicked, and not the most recently added.

When removing a todo, delete it from the DB.

More things to come!
